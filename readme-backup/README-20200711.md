# :merman: Hi, nice to meet you here!

Github & Open Source is fantastic, isn't it?

For the time being in Beijing, China, I'm researching on:

* :clown_face: [React](https://github.com/facebook/react): for I am a `frontend engineer` and this is my first `career`.
* :sauropod: [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno): for contributing to `future web applications` and broadening my `programming skills`.
* :space_invader: [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest): for using a mature framework in `Node.js` ecology and build infrastructure for `NingoWood`.
* :art: [Open Source](https://www.google.com/search?q=open+source): for learning the `philosophy`, and building bricks for `China's` open source ecology step by step!

About Deno, I focused on [deno-tutorial](https://github.com/hylerrix/deno-tutorial)(Chinese Version) repo for now, and have a lot of ideas about its future.

And I'm a big fan of indie games and excellent cinema. Building a home theater and connecting to my self-made Home LAN is my long term goal.
