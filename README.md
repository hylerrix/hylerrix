# :merman: Hi, nice to meet you in 2021!

Github & Open Source is fantastic, isn't it?

For the time being in Beijing, China in 2021, I'm trying to focus on:

* :tv: Frontend Architecture: `JAMStack`, `Micro Frontends` & `Serverless`, plus: Operate a `business server` for `NingoWood`.
* :sauropod: Deno: Through [`deno-feedly`](https://github.com/hylerrix/deno-feedly) repo, starting paying my attention to the Deno international community every week.
* :space_invader: Deno(Chinese): Make contribution around [`deno-tutorial`](https://github.com/hylerrix/deno-tutorial)repo, and implement various good ideas about its future.
* :clown_face: React: Through [`react-v17-handbook`](https://github.com/hylerrix/react-v17-handbook) repo, learn React & Frontend deeper 'n' deeper.
* :writing_hand: Writing: Start writing more English original articles from scratch about `Programming`(in different repo) & `Life`(in this repo).
* :open_book: [Open Source](https://www.google.com/search?q=open+source): for learning the `philosophy`, and building bricks for `China's` open source ecology step by step!
* :art: English: Yeah, of course. I feel so ignorant about everything in English World, embracing a more different culture is the thing that I wish, want, and must have to do.

And I'm a big fan of indie games and excellent cinema. Building a home theater and connecting to my self-made Home LAN is my long term goal.
