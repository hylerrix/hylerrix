# :merman: Hi, nice to meet you in 2021!

Github & Open Source is fantastic, isn't it? For the time being in Beijing, China, 2021, I'm trying to focus on:

* :tv: **Frontend Architecture**: `JAMStack`, `Micro Frontends` & `Serverless`, plus: Operate a `Business Server` for `NingoWood`.
* :sauropod: **Deno**: Through [`deno-feedly`](https://github.com/hylerrix/deno-feedly) repo, starting to pay attention to the Deno international community every week.
* :space_invader: **Deno(Chinese)**: Make contribute around [`deno-tutorial`](https://github.com/hylerrix/deno-tutorial)repo, and effectuate various good ideas about its future.
* :clown_face: **React**: Through [`react-v17-handbook`](https://github.com/hylerrix/react-v17-handbook) repo, grasp React & Frontend deeper 'n' deeper.
* :open_book: **Open Source**: Through [`open-source-magazine`](https://github.com/ningowood/open-source-magazine), building bricks for `China's` open source ecology step by step!
* :writing_hand: **Writing**: Start writing more English original articles from scratch, about `Programming` & `Life` in [`hylerrix.com`](https://github.com/hylerrix/hylerrix.com) repo.
* :art: **English**: Yeah, of course. I feel so ignorant about everything in English World, embracing a more different culture is the thing that I wish, want, and must have to do.

And I'm a big fan of indie games and excellent cinema. Building a home theater and connecting to my self-made Home LAN is my long term goal.
